Stock data will be graphed and the cyclical events can be filtered on top of the graph. There will be multiple chart styles such as line and candlestick. The stocks will be limited to Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta. Our purpose is to create an application that makes ridiculous correlations between stock data and something random.",
